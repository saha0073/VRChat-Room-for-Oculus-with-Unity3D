 This repo conatins a VR Chat room made using Unity, Blender, and VRChat SDK. The room has been designed at first in Blender, and then it has been imported in Unity. Subsequently, the physics, colliders, lightings,
 and interactions has been added in Unity. Finally, VR Chat SDK has been utilized to add the interaction such as grabbing the objects, sitting in the chairs, toggling the buttons, and navigating in the room.
 To make the room more interesting Ai/ML features can be integrated in the next step. 
 
 ## Techniques Used
 * GameEngine: Unity3D 19.4
 * Tech Stack: C#
 * Packages: VRChat SDK
 * Design tools: Blender 3.0

## Future Directions
To make the room more intersting Ai/ML features can be integrated in the room. These are several possible directions,
* Engaging games can be added up in the room. The computer will be trained in the game using Reinforcement Learning and the visitors will play against the computer.
* The room can contain GAN generated paintaings in the walls, and the viewers might enjoy the wall paintings while hanging out in the room.
* The room can be setup to broadcast the major live sports events, and machine learning algorithm can be used in ranking the live sports events. 

Thank you!
